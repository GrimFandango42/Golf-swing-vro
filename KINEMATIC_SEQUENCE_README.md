# Kinematic Sequence Analysis for SwingSync AI

## Overview

This implementation adds sophisticated kinematic sequence analysis to the SwingSync AI golf app - analyzing the order and timing of body segment accelerations during the downswing for optimal power generation.

## What is Kinematic Sequence?

The kinematic sequence is the foundation of power generation in golf. It refers to the specific order and timing of peak velocities through the body's kinetic chain:

1. **Pelvis** - Initiates the downswing
2. **Torso** - Follows the pelvis (~75ms later)  
3. **Arms** - Follow the torso (~75ms later)
4. **Club** - Peaks last for maximum energy transfer

## Key Features Implemented

### 🎯 **Core Analysis**
- **Sequence Order Detection**: Validates proper pelvis → torso → arms → club sequence
- **Peak Velocity Calculation**: Identifies maximum angular velocities for each segment
- **Timing Gap Analysis**: Measures intervals between segment peaks (optimal: 50-100ms)
- **Efficiency Scoring**: 0-100% score based on sequence quality and timing

### ⚡ **Performance Optimized**
- **<50ms Analysis Time**: Optimized for real-time mobile processing
- **Pure Python Implementation**: No external dependencies (lite version)
- **Intelligent Caching**: Prevents redundant calculations
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal memory footprint

### 📊 **New KPIs Added**
1. **Kinematic Sequence Order** - Correct vs Incorrect sequence
2. **Kinematic Timing Efficiency** - Percentage score (0-100%)
3. **Power Transfer Rating** - Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor rating

### 🎨 **Visualization Ready**
- **Multi-line Velocity Charts**: Real-time velocity curves for all segments
