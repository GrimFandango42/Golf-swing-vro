## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from adaptive_coaching import create_adaptive_coaching_system

# Create the adaptive coaching system
adaptive_coach = create_adaptive_coaching_system()

# Process a coaching request
response = await adaptive_coach.process_coaching_request(
    user_id="user123",
    session_id="session001", 
    user_message="How can I improve my swing consistency?",
    swing_analysis={
        "overall_score": 65.2,
        "fault_count": 2,
        "consistency_score": 0.7
    },
    context={
        "emotional_state": "frustrated",
        "engagement_level": 0.6
    }
)

print(response['response'])  # Personalized coaching response
print(response['achievements'])  # Any achievements unlocked
print(response['next_recommendations'])  # Next steps
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
# Run the interactive demo
python demo_adaptive_coaching.py

# Choose from:
# 1. Full Demo (automated)
# 2. Interactive Demo  
# 3. Both
```

## 📚 Core Components

### 1. User Learning Engine (`user_learning_engine.py`)

The central intelligence that builds comprehensive user profiles and learns from interactions.

**Key Features:**
- Learns user swing patterns and common faults
- Tracks coaching effectiveness and response preferences
- Maintains long-term memory of user journey
- Adapts coaching strategies based on what works

**Usage:**
```python
from adaptive_coaching import UserLearningEngine

engine = UserLearningEngine()

# Record an interaction
interaction_id = engine.record_interaction(
    user_id="user123",
    coaching_approach="encouraging",
    feedback_type="technical_feedback", 
    message_sent="Focus on your hip rotation...",
    user_response="Thanks, that helps!"
)

# Get coaching recommendations
recommendations = engine.get_coaching_recommendations("user123")
```

### 2. Pattern Recognition (`pattern_recognition.py`)

Advanced pattern recognition for identifying user behaviors and swing tendencies.

**Detected Patterns:**
- Swing fault patterns (chronic, progressive, situational)
- Learning behavior patterns (fast/slow learner, analytical vs. experiential)
- Performance trends (breakthrough moments, plateau periods)
- Contextual patterns (club-specific performance, timing effects)

**Usage:**
```python
from adaptive_coaching import PatternRecognizer

recognizer = PatternRecognizer()

# Analyze swing patterns
swing_patterns = recognizer.analyze_swing_patterns(user_id, swing_data)

# Analyze learning behavior
behavior_patterns = recognizer.analyze_learning_behavior(user_id, interaction_data)

# Get pattern insights
insights = recognizer.get_pattern_insights(user_id)
```

### 3. Coaching Adaptation Engine (`coaching_adaptation.py`)

Personalizes coaching responses based on user patterns and effectiveness data.

**Adaptation Strategies:**
- Effectiveness-based (use what works best for the user)
- Pattern-based (adapt to recognized user patterns)
- Emotional state (adjust tone and approach based on user mood)
- Learning style (adapt to visual, analytical, kinesthetic preferences)
- Progressive (adjust complexity based on user progress)

**Usage:**
```python
from adaptive_coaching import CoachingAdaptationEngine, CoachingContext

adapter = CoachingAdaptationEngine()

# Create coaching context
context = CoachingContext(
    user_id="user123",
    session_id="session001",
    emotional_state="frustrated",
    engagement_level=0.6
)

# Adapt a response
adapted_response = adapter.adapt_response(
    user_id="user123",
    original_response="Your swing looks good, but try adjusting your grip.",
    coaching_context=context
)
```

### 4. Progress Predictor (`progress_predictor.py`)

ML-powered system for predicting user progress and recommending personalized goals.

**Predictions:**
- Progress trajectory forecasting
- Breakthrough timing prediction
- Goal achievement probability
- Optimal practice schedules
- Performance ceiling analysis

**Usage:**
```python
from adaptive_coaching import ProgressPredictor

predictor = ProgressPredictor()

# Predict progress trajectory
trajectory = predictor.predict_progress(user_id, historical_data, prediction_horizon=30)

# Predict goal achievement
goal_prediction = predictor.predict_goal_achievement(user_id, target_score=70, current_score=65, historical_data)

# Get personalized goals
goals = predictor.get_personalized_goals(user_id, historical_data, goal_count=3)
```

### 5. Memory & Context Manager (`memory_context_manager.py`)

Intelligent memory system for maintaining context and continuity across sessions.

**Memory Types:**
- Conversational (chat history and context)
- Factual (user preferences and characteristics) 
- Procedural (learned skills and techniques)
- Episodic (specific events and sessions)
- Semantic (general knowledge about user)
- Emotional (emotional states and triggers)

**Usage:**
```python
from adaptive_coaching import MemoryContextManager
from adaptive_coaching.memory_context_manager import MemoryType, MemoryImportance

memory_manager = MemoryContextManager()

# Store a memory
memory_id = memory_manager.store_memory(
    user_id="user123",
    content="User prefers detailed technical explanations",
    memory_type=MemoryType.FACTUAL,
    importance=MemoryImportance.HIGH,
    tags=["preference", "learning_style"]
)

# Recall relevant memories
memories = memory_manager.recall_memories(
    user_id="user123", 
    query="technical explanations",
    limit=5
)
```

### 6. User Profiling System (`user_profiling.py`)

Advanced profiling system that detects learning styles and creates detailed user profiles.

**Learning Styles Detected:**
- Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic
- Analytical vs. Global
- Sequential vs. Random
- Reflective vs. Active

**Profile Components:**
- Learning characteristics and preferences
- Motivation types and triggers
- Communication style preferences
- Behavioral patterns
- Personality traits

**Usage:**
```python
from adaptive_coaching import UserProfilingSystem

profiler = UserProfilingSystem()

# Analyze user profile
profile = profiler.analyze_user(user_id, interaction_data, performance_data)

# Get coaching recommendations
recommendations = profiler.get_coaching_recommendations(user_id)

# Get profile summary
summary = profiler.get_profile_summary(user_id)
```

### 7. Effectiveness Tracker (`effectiveness_tracker.py`)

Comprehensive system for tracking coaching effectiveness and optimizing strategies.

**Tracking Capabilities:**
- Real-time effectiveness measurement
- A/B testing framework
- Success pattern identification
- ML-powered optimization
- Coaching quality metrics

**Usage:**
```python
from adaptive_coaching import EffectivenessTracker
from adaptive_coaching.effectiveness_tracker import CoachingStrategy

tracker = EffectivenessTracker()

# Record interaction effectiveness
record_id = tracker.record_interaction_effectiveness(
    user_id="user123",
    session_id="session001",
    interaction_id="interaction001",
    coaching_strategy=CoachingStrategy.ENCOURAGING,
    coaching_content="Great progress on your swing!",
    context={"user_satisfaction": 0.9}
)

# Get effectiveness analysis
analysis = tracker.get_effectiveness_analysis(user_id)

# Start A/B test experiment
experiment_id = tracker.start_experiment(
    user_id="user123",
    experiment_name="Technical vs Encouraging",
    control_strategy=CoachingStrategy.TECHNICAL,
    test_strategy=CoachingStrategy.ENCOURAGING,
    hypothesis="User responds better to encouraging approach"
)
```

### 8. Celebration System (`celebration_system.py`)

Intelligent achievement recognition and celebration system.

**Achievement Types:**
- Personal bests and milestones
- Breakthrough moments
- Consistency achievements  
- Goal completions
- Technical mastery
- First-time accomplishments

**Celebration Styles:**
- Enthusiastic, Supportive, Analytical
- Quiet recognition, Motivational
- Personalized based on user preferences

**Usage:**
```python
from adaptive_coaching import CelebrationSystem

celebration = CelebrationSystem()

# Analyze session for achievements
achievements = celebration.analyze_session_for_achievements(
    user_id="user123",
    session_data={"overall_score": 75, "consistency_score": 0.9},
    historical_data=historical_sessions
)

# Generate celebrations
