Conversational Coaching System Demo

This script demonstrates the conversational coaching capabilities of the SwingSync AI
platform, showing how voice-driven coaching integrates with swing analysis.

Features demonstrated:
- Voice-to-text conversation processing
- Context-aware coaching responses
- Integration with swing analysis results
- Different coaching personalities
- Real-time conversation flow
