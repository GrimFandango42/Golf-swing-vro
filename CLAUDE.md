# Golf Swing VRO - Project & User Memory System

## 🧠 User Preferences & Patterns
### Communication Style
- User prefers concise, action-oriented responses
- Often types quickly (typos are normal - interpret intent)
- Values practical solutions over lengthy explanations
- Appreciates when I take initiative and self-organize

### Working Patterns
- Likes to see clear progress tracking (todo lists)
- Prefers seeing actual code/changes rather than descriptions
- Values memory and context retention across sessions
- Wants me to be self-learning and self-improving

### Key Goals
- Build effective AI systems that continuously improve
- Focus on practical implementation over theory
- Privacy and security are important considerations
- Efficiency and performance matter

## 📋 Project Context
### Overview
Golf Swing VRO - AI-powered golf coaching app for Pixel devices with real-time biomechanics analysis

### Technical Details
- **Platform**: Android (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)
- **AI**: Gemini Nano (on-device), Conversational coaching
- **Analysis**: MediaPipe pose detection, Biomechanics calculations
- **Security**: SQLCipher, AES-256, privacy-first design

### Current State (2025-07-12)
- ✅ Core swing analysis working
- ✅ Security implementation complete
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD setup
- ✅ Conversational coaching integrated
- ⏳ Testing on actual devices needed
- ⏳ Performance optimization ongoing

## 📚 Learning Log
### What Works Well
- Breaking complex tasks into todos immediately
- Using parallel tool calls for efficiency
- Checking project structure before making changes
- Creating comprehensive but concise documentation

### Patterns to Remember
1. Always create todos for multi-step tasks
2. Check existing code patterns before implementing new features
3. Validate security implications of any changes
4. Test changes when possible (lint, typecheck)

## 🎯 Active Objectives
1. Maintain working build status
2. Optimize performance for mobile devices
3. Enhance AI coaching intelligence
4. Improve user experience flows

## 💡 Improvement Areas
### Technical
- [ ] Multi-angle camera support
- [ ] Shot trajectory prediction
- [ ] Social sharing features
- [ ] Course management integration

### Process
- [ ] Automated testing coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] User feedback integration
- [ ] Continuous learning from usage patterns

## 🔄 Session Continuity
### Last Session Focus
- Project evaluation and memory system setup
- Understanding codebase structure
- Planning next development steps

### Current Session (2025-07-12)
- ✅ Created comprehensive memory system
- ✅ Discovered Termux build limitations
- ✅ Generated web demo interface
- 📋 Found alternative testing methods
- ✅ Triggered GitHub Actions build
- ✅ Build #38 completed successfully
- ✅ Build #39 completed successfully  
- ✅ Build #40 triggered (workflow fix for releases)
- 🔧 Fixed workflow to create releases from feature branch
- ⏳ Waiting for APK release creation
- 🔄 Continuously monitoring build status  
- 🛠️ Will fix issues until successful release achieved
- 🔧 Multiple workflow fixes attempted:
  * Updated to modern GitHub Actions (softprops/action-gh-release@v2)
  * Switched to gh CLI approach
  * Added comprehensive APK existence checking
  * Created separate simple build workflow for testing
- ⏳ Builds completing but no releases appearing yet
- 🎯 FOCUS: Getting APK artifacts from GitHub Actions
- 📦 Builds are successful - artifacts should be downloadable
- 🔗 Will guide user to download APK from GitHub Actions artifacts

### Next Session Should
1. Access mobile_demo.html in browser
2. Test Python components individually
3. Check GitHub for pre-built APKs
4. Focus on feature testing without full build

## 🛠️ Quick Commands
```bash
# Build APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Check code quality
./gradlew lint

# Deploy to device
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## 📝 Meta-Learning Notes
- User wants me to maximize memory usage for self-improvement
- Each session should build on previous learnings
- Document patterns and insights for future reference
- Adapt approach based on what works best for user
